# so basically how to change a list to lowercase is just do this:
# [(list u wanna change).lower() for (list u wanna change) in (list u wanna change)]
# ye I guest.....It works anyway.

# just a easier example

list20 = ["List"]

list10 == list20
# U should get False

list10_lower == list20_lower
# U should get True
